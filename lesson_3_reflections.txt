When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is needed if collaboration is required on the projects or if you want to share the projects with others.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having the changes automatically pulled into local might introduce unnecessary commits without the permission into the local repository. Thus, if someone else is working on the project and pushes changes to the remote and then Git automatically updates all of the local repositories then even though I didnt have made any changes into the repository still the new commits will appear into my local repository.Also, the unnecessary commits may be a new feature update which is not yet released to the general public code version and you may want to release it only when it is tested for quality purpose. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a feature on GitHub that lets you clone other peoples repository without the need to clone it in your local repo and then use it.Clone is a feture that allows you to download repository hosted as remote on GitHub or make a copy of local repository  to to other location in ur local repo.Branch is created as a collection of new commit path if you want to make some experimental features,updates to your existing commit in the main commit path(also called as master)
